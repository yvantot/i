			app-description="I made this story to express my experience of having a severe-acne.
			There was a time where I fell in love with the idea of writing and making stories.
			But life is, I don't know, I don't even want to blame life for my decisions, maybe it's just me.
			I stopped making art and writing because I was not sure of the path I was taking, or will I even make money from it?			
			The time it took for 2 Speckles episode is 1 month, that's an insane amount of time.
			And the language-barrier is insane. I'm a one-man army trying to publish a webtoon episode, trying to translate my thoughts, craft dialogues into another language is no-joke.
			I was writing/drawing for 10 hrs a day and I was so burnt-out.
			I remember that time where my thumb feels so fucking numb that I can't sketch with my stylus-pen, it's insane.
			It's a continous torture, I don't even know if I enjoyed doing it. 
			But one thing I'm sure of is that I would totally devote my life to writing if it's not for the need of money.
			I think if I get rich before I die, I would go back on writing."

			app-name="Entries for poster making"
			app-description="The story is that I needed money and there was a boom on digital posters competitions.
			I have no experience on making digital arts, but I badly need cash.
			I spent a year on making entries everyday and submitting them for contests.
			It was an insane run, I nearly fried my brain from thinking of different layouts, ideas, colors.
			You can see that some of my posters are hands-down shit, but it keeps getting better and better because I kept making entries.
			Out of every submissions here, I won 7 of them (additional 5 or more posters I participated face-to-face which I don't have a copy).
			
			Overall, I bagged P50,000+ cash prize but eventually, I got bored and pursued programming."
