			It's possible that your Messenger might flinch and the changes may take a while to reflect on your inbox. That's perfectly fine, this feature is not intended by the official app, so Messenger will groan from pain (100+ request within a second from a single user!), but it'll be fine."

			Muni, it allows you to memorize everything while you're watching TikTok brainrot reels.
			Feed it your learning material and it'll generate cards for you.
			Those cards will popup periodically (or dynamically based on your card's mastery) to make topics stick to your brain.
			'Remember forever?' why not, 'while scrolling useless junks on Reddit' sure."

			'But why should I install it?' To be honest, I don't know. I made this because I need it.
			Anyway, if you've come this far. I ought to tell you why you should use this extension.
			Let me make up one...
			Have you read the book Atomic Habits by James Clear?
			Broooo - the sheer volume of aura reading '1% better everyday' in your newtab will catapult your motivation through the roof.
			And imagine, you're so motivated right, like you're hyped! And now, this is the reason why 'links' is supported.
			You can point that motivation towards an action, exactly! A link to KhanAcademy or something."

			The reason why I made this is I felt the need to limit my websites usage.
			So I would start a timer, name it like 'Procrastinate', set it for 30 minutes and be guilt-free from my 'time-wasting'.
			It shows the current time in extension icon, you can set a name, or description; all of which will show up in notification."
