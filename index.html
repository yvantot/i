			Those cards will popup periodically (or dynamically based on your card's mastery) to make topics stick to your brain.
			'Remember forever?' why not, 'while scrolling useless junks on Reddit' sure."

			Add text, essays, poems, quotes in your newtab, links works too.
			'But why should I install it?' To be honest, I don't know. I made this because I need it.
			Anyway, if you've come this far. I ought to tell you why you should use this extension.
			Let me make up one...
			Have you read the book Atomic Habits by James Clear?
			Broooo - the sheer volume of aura reading '1% better everyday' in your newtab will catapult your motivation through the roof.
			And imagine, you're so motivated right, like you're hyped! And now, this is the reason why 'links' is supported.
			You can point that motivation towards an action, exactly! A link to KhanAcademy or something."

			app-name="Simple Timer"
			app-description="It's a timer, as an extension.
			The reason why I made this is I felt the need to limit my websites usage.
			So I would start a timer, name it like 'Procrastinate', set it for 30 minutes and be guilt-free from my 'time-wasting'.
			It shows the current time in extension icon, you can set a name, or description; all of which will show up in notification."

			app-description="I made this one to learn React.
			I don't have anything to talk about because this app is relatively simple, it's literally a todo-list.
			So yeah, React is an amazing framework. JSX looks better than what I'm currently doing right now (custom elements).
			I learned React, but I don't want to use it for my personal projects because it felt overkill and needlessly complicated.
			I want to keep my stacks for my babies as simple as I can."

			API? Whoa, sounds very scary and complicatteeeddd- nope.
			I was even afraid to start, creating UI outlines, researching how they work under the hood...
			I should've just started doing things and learn afterwards to maximise the emotional hurtness of failing and brutal realizations."

			The experience was a blast. The stakes are very high for every clients and I'd often feel the need to vomit from anxiety and stress.
			But it was so rewarding. Every time you conquer the seemingly 'impossible' requests from clients, they become your standard for the next commission.

			It was fairly simple, and fun!
			I love it when I'm not proficient on something like with this GUI builder or Java, I'd hack things together (even if they're inefficient) to do what I want my program to do.
			Like this bar graph."
